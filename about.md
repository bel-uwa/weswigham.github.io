Hello there! I'm Wesley Wigham, a Software Engineer enrolled at Rochester Institute of Technology. I take interest in most anything software related, and sometimes hardware, too. I've written applications, modules, or scripts in Lua, Javascript, Python, C#, Ruby, C, Java, C++, and Haskell. Quite a variety, in my opinion. 

If I had to choose a favorite for elegant, fast scripts - I'd choose Lua. If I have to choose a favorite for ease of use - I'd be torn between the batteries-included C# and Javascript.  

You can find some of the things that I've done on my [github](https://github.com/weswigham) profile.
